# Quintuplet
Precise calculation of the mass of Dark Matter, as Quintuplet under SU(2).

Initial steps:

1 - compute Bessel functions K1 and K2 with high precision, then relevant factor for number density and abundance
2 - compute thermal average of annihilation cross sections (as of now with the Hulten potential approximation) and bound state formation rates
3 - TODO
